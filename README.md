# Offside Proof of Concept

This website is a proof of concept for a product that helps to explain the offside rule in Football.

The user is presented with a top-down view of a 5-a-side football game and can drag the players of the two teams around the pitch. The website will indicate whether the positioning of the players means that the team in possession is offside or not.

This project was created using ReactJS.

The proof of concept demo is hosted on GitHub pages and can be visited here: https://chiefantiphates.github.io/offside/
